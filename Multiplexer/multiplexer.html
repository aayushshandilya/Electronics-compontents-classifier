            <p>In electronics, a multiplexer (or mux; spelled sometimes as multiplexor), also known as a data selector, is a device that selects between several analog or digital input signals and forwards it to a single output line.A multiplexer of 2^n inputs has n select lines, which are used to select which input line to send to the output.</p>
